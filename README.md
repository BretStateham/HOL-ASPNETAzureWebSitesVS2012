# Building and Publishing ASP.NET Applications with Windows Azure Web Sites and Visual Studio 2012 #

## Hands-on Lab ##

### Introduction ###

Hands-on labs are sets of step-by-step guides that are designed to help you learn how to use key Windows Azure services and features. Each lab provides instructions to guide you through the process of developing and deploying applications.

In this hands-on lab, you will explore the basic elements of the **Windows Azure Web Sites** service by creating a simple [ASP.NET MVC 4](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc4) application, which uses scaffolding to automatically generate the baseline of your application's CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete). Then, you will deploy it using Web Deploy from Visual Studio 2012 and Git commit.

> **Note:** You can download the latest build of the Windows Azure Training Kit which includes a tested version of this HOL from here: http://bit.ly/WindowsAzureTK.

### Get Started ###

In order to run the solutions of the exercises provided by this lab, you will first need to configure your environment and install any necessary prerequisites such as runtimes, components, or libraries. For your ease, you can download and run the dependency checker [here] (http://contentinstaller.blob.core.windows.net/dependency-checker/DC.exe) to automatically check and install all the requirements.  Each lab also includes setup instructions for getting started.
